## Hello! Welcome to my First Post

Hello, my name is Cristiano and I am a front-end developer based in Edinburgh, UK. I quit my full-time job in July of this year to focus on my self-learning journey in programming.

I am making this blog as a means to document my progress throughout learning and hopefully teach you something new along the way. Looking forward to this!
